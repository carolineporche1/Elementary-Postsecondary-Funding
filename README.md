# Federal Funding: Elementary vs Postsecondary Education

## Overview

This project focuses on comparing the trends and allocations of federal funding for elementary education and postsecondary education in the United States from 2000 to 2022. The goal of the analysis is to highlight the differences in how federal funds are distributed to these two key educational sectors and explore how this distribution has evolved over time.

Federal funding plays a crucial role in shaping educational opportunities, resources, and programs. By analyzing historical data, we can better understand how the U.S. government prioritizes spending across different educational levels and programs, as well as the impact of emergency funding measures in times of crisis, such as the pandemic.

## Research Focus

The primary research questions addressed in this project include:
- **How has federal funding for elementary education changed from 2000 to 2022?**
- **How has federal funding for postsecondary education evolved during the same period?**
- **What major events or policy changes have influenced the distribution of funds between these two sectors?**
- **How did pandemic-related relief programs (CARES Act, CRRSA Act, and ARP Act) affect funding for both elementary and postsecondary education?**
- **Are there specific programs or areas within elementary and postsecondary education that received disproportionate changes in funding?**

This project includes various visualizations to help illustrate:
- **Federal funding trends** for elementary and postsecondary education over time.
- **Program-specific breakdowns** showing how funds were allocated to different areas such as special education, financial aid, and child nutrition programs.
- **Impact of pandemic-related relief** on both sectors, highlighting the unprecedented levels of funding provided during 2020-2021.

## Conclusions

- **Elementary Education**: While funding has shown steady growth over the years, there have been significant increases during periods of economic recovery and crisis (2021 and 2022)
- **Postsecondary Education**: Federal funding for higher education, particularly through financial aid and loan programs, has grown significantly over the past two decades. The introduction of the Post-9/11 GI Bill and pandemic relief measures further boosted support for students seeking higher education.

## Future Directions

Further research could focus on:
- Exploring state-level funding patterns for elementary and postsecondary education.
- Analyzing the long-term effects of the COVID-19 pandemic on federal education funding.
- Investigating the impact of federal funding on educational outcomes, such as graduation rates and student performance.

## Data Sources

The data for this analysis comes from the **National Center for Education Statistics (NCES)** and covers various federal departments and programs that provide funding for education. The dataset includes yearly federal budget allocations for key education-related departments and programs. These programs target different educational needs, ranging from general education support to specific programs like special education, child nutrition, and financial aid for postsecondary students.
